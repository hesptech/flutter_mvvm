maintainable and testable user interfaces
separation of concerns: allows for a more testable and maintainable codebase
loosely coupled architecture: greater flexibility and reusability of code


TESTING
Model can be tested with unit tests, 

The View and ViewModel can be tested with integration tests
Additionally, the ViewModel can be tested with mock objects, which allows for testing the logic of the ViewModel without the need for a real View.
